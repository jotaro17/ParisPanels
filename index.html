        <p>Send messages as if they were writing on the panels of the City of Paris. Use any type of messages: funny, hangouts, congratulations, hot, love, jokes, anything goes!</p>

<p>You can share them on your favorite social networks or save them to your library.</p>

<p>This app is a small gift I always wanted to do for Paris and its people. Not in any way seek to create confusion, or mar the work of the City of Paris, use it responsibly and enjoy!</p>
